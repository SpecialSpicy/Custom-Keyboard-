Welcome to the Custom Keyboard Configurator 
                                  
You are interested in building a Custom Keyboard but you don't know which parts to pick. You have heard somewhere about a config but you don't know how much it'll cost or how it'll sound like or you just wanna explore builds and hear what they sound like or look like. If you find yourself in one of these situations, then this application is the right one for you. Simply choose a part and watch a recommended review about it. Then you can do the same for the other parts and at the end you can listen to a soundtest and see the config in all its glory. With the API Keys, you can see the up to date status of a keyboard part and if it's available, you can click on 'buy' and it'll redirect you to the website (in most cases it's either drop.com or kbdfans.com). In the future there is even more to come. Right now I need to work on it :D

After you click on 'Start', choose a Keyboard Kit, a Keycap Set and a Switch Set and click on each to hear a recommended sound test. On the left side of each Keyboard part, there is a price. (Right now only on the keyboard kit)
