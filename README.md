                          !This Application is in Alpha and still does not work as intended!
                                    
                                    Welcome to Keyboard Configurator 
                                  
This application is supposed to show you the available parts that are popular and you can choose a part to view and watch a review about it. You can also make a config that you prefer after watching the reviews and hear a sound test of the config you made. You can also see the price or find out about the status of each item. Furthermore, you can also see the newest events happening (The newest Keyboard kit that is on sale e.g). Right Now, I am working on it though :D
