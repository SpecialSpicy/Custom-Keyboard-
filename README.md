                          !This Application is in Alpha and still does not work as intended!
                          
In later alpha/beta versions, it will be able to send requests to kbdfans, drop and etc. and get the newest price or status of an item (kit, keycap set or switch set)
and then it'll show you them. Later it should also have a sound test for each chosen set of kit and switches (keycaps mostly not included, since it doesn't make the biggest difference if they're all cherry profile)
